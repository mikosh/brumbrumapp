  <h3>§ 8 BrumBrum platform</h3>
  <p>(1) Description of service: BrumBrum provides an Internet platform at www.brumbrum.club (“portal”) and client software for use by mobile devices (cell phone, GPS) for partially automated brokering of opportunities for ride sharing. Persons offering a ride (“drivers”) and persons seeking a ride (“passengers”) enter their planned route on the portal or mobile device, BrumBrum matches the route and suggests passengers or drivers. Passengers and drivers can contact each other through the portal or mobile device.</p>
  <p>(2) Contractual relationships: BrumBrum does not provide any rides itself and is not a party to any ride share agreement. The ride share agreement is exclusively between driver and passenger. Claims arising out of the ride share agreement are exclusively between driver and passenger. BrumBrum does not guarantee successful brokerage of ride sharing opportunities. No guarantee is given. BrumBrum is not liable for successful brokerage or completion of a ride.</p>
  <p>(3) Users: Users must sign in to use the BrumBrum platform. BrumBrum is entitled to reject applications without giving any reason. Only natural persons are entitled to register as users. Each user is responsible for checking the identity of parties to an agreement and the correctness of other data. The possibility cannot be ruled out that a user account may have false contact and other data. BrumBrum does not normally check the identity of users.</p>
  <p>(4) User content: The portal offers users the technical opportunity to publish their own content (routes, ratings, profile information, etc.). Content published by users on the portal is not reviewed by BrumBrum and does not represent BrumBrum ’s opinion. If there are indications of abuse or illegal content, BrumBrum will however review reported content, and may delete it. By publishing content on the portal, the user warrants that it is free from third party rights and grants BrumBrum a free, unrestricted, simple right of use in the content.</p>
  <p>(5) Obligations of the driver: Drivers must possess a valid driving licence and third party insurance. Drivers must be fit to drive at the start of a journey. Drivers are liable for complying with relevant applicable legislation and regulations, such as the road traffic regulations or the passenger transportation regulations or corresponding legislation and regulations for travel abroad.</p>
  <p>(6) Ratings: The portal enables users to evaluate each other after completion of a ride agreement. Ratings are not normally checked by BrumBrum. Users are obliged to give only truthful information in ratings and must comply with the law. All use of the rating system other than for this intended purpose is prohibited. Specifically, users are prohibited from making abusive or improper ratings, rating themselves or having third parties submit self-ratings, including circumstances in ratings which are not connected with performance of the underlying agreement, or using ratings for a purpose not connected with the portal.</p>
  <p>(7) BrumBrum’s rights: BrumBrum  is entitled at all times to remove user offers and requests or user profiles from the portal. BrumBrum  reserves the right to prevent excluded users from registering, including by technical filters.</p>

  <p>(9) Exclusion of liability: BrumBrum is not liable for loss and injury arising out of a ride share opportunity brokered on the portal. This exclusion of liability applies to all types of loss and injury, and specifically for loss of profit or indirect loss, regardless of whether this is to the user or third parties.
