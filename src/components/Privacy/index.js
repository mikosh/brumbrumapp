  </p>
  <h3>How we use information we collect</h3>
  <p>We use the information we collect on our service to provide, maintain, protect and improve it.
  </p>
  <h3>Transparency and choice</h3>
  <p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:
    <ul>
      <li>Delete your account.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.</p>

  <h3>Information we share</h3>
  <p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of BrumBrum unless one of the following circumstances apply:
    <ul>
      <li>
        For legal reasons. We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of BrumBrum if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
        <ul>
          <li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li>
          <li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>

  <p>We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.</p>
  <p>If BrumBrum is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
